# phobos.js v3

`v3` represents a complete rewrite of `phobos.js` to use the most modern Javascript principles.

## Status

This branch is not yet even alpha, so it is definitely not recommended to be used.

## What's changed?

 * The new engine for `phobos.js` will be [Koa](http://koajs.com)
 * Controllers, schemas and scopes are simplified into "Resources"
 * The new `phobos.js` will be entirely based on classes: to create a new route or resource, one must simply extend the correct class
 * Much more

## Timelines

A workable alpha and possibly a beta should be done by the end of November 2016.

## Backwards compatibility

`v3` will not be compatible with any previous version of `phobos.js` and will require extensive changes.
